# Hey, I'm Shua
I'm interested in open-source projects, especially in the medical field. I mostly do software engineering.

## I work with:

I mostly prefer working with the front end side of things, not limited to:
- Vue.js
- Next.js
- Laravel Blade
- Plain HTML/CSS

## Projects
Here are some of my projects:
- [PenicilliSolver](https://github.com/shua24/penicillisolver) - A web app for medical professionals that converts antimicrobial test tables into a readable format
- [Nerovim](https://github.com/shua24/nerovim) - A custom, less-bloated modular neovim configuration

## Other Works
I casually work with Linux systems. I'm currently learning about how to do CI and CD alongside Docker beyond web programming itself. I enjoy playing around
with Linux. I am also interested in privacy-oriented systems, as well as safety-critical systems. I find it interesting when privacy-oriented systems can be
met with creativity.
